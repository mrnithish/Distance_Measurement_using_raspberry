# Distance Measurement with Raspberry Pi and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Overview

This project enables distance measurement using a Raspberry Pi and an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor sends and receives sound waves to calculate the distance to an object, making it a useful tool for various applications.

## Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply for Raspberry Pi

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS installed on your Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x

## Wiring

Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins as follows:
- VCC to 5V
- Trig to GPIO Pin (e.g., GPIO17)
- Echo to GPIO Pin (e.g., GPIO18)
- GND to GND

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultrasonic-distance-measurement.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Distance_Measurement_using_raspberry
```

3. Run the Python script to measure distances.

```bash
python main.py
```

4. The script will display real-time distance measurements on the console.

## Configuration

- You can configure the GPIO pins and measurement parameters in the `distance_measurement.py` script to match your setup.
